## Definition & Taxonomy

### What is Agentic AI?

Agentic AI refers to artificial intelligence systems designed to act autonomously or semi-autonomously on behalf of users to accomplish tasks. Unlike traditional AI systems that respond directly to specific queries, agentic AI systems can:

- Take initiative and make decisions based on goals
- Plan and execute multi-step processes
- Use tools and interact with external systems
- Learn from past experiences and adapt behavior
- Maintain persistent memory across interactions

What distinguishes agentic AI from related concepts:

| Concept | Key Distinction |
|---------|----------------|
| Chatbots | Agentic AI goes beyond conversation to take actions in digital environments |
| Traditional AI Assistants | Agents can operate autonomously without continuous human guidance |
| Expert Systems | Modern agents use foundation models rather than explicit rule bases |
| Robotic Process Automation (RPA) | Agents can handle novel situations and aren't limited to predefined workflows |
| Digital Twins | Agents act on behalf of users rather than simulating physical systems |

### Agent Taxonomy

Agentic AI systems can be categorized along several dimensions:

**By Autonomy Level:**
- **Assistive Agents**: Require human confirmation for most actions (human-in-the-loop)
- **Supervised Agents**: Operate independently but check with humans at critical decision points
- **Autonomous Agents**: Execute complete tasks with minimal human intervention

**By Architectural Pattern:**
- **Single-Agent Systems**: Individual agents working on specific tasks
- **Multi-Agent Systems**: Multiple agents collaborating to accomplish complex goals
- **Agent Swarms**: Large numbers of simple agents working together with emergent behavior

**By Domain Specialization:**
- **General-Purpose Agents**: Designed to handle a wide variety of tasks
- **Domain-Specific Agents**: Optimized for particular industries or task types
- **Function-Specific Agents**: Focused on narrow task categories (e.g., calendar management)

**By Learning Capability:**
- **Static Agents**: Behavior is fixed after deployment
- **Adaptive Agents**: Continuously learn from interactions and outcomes
- **Self-Improving Agents**: Capable of modifying their own strategies and capabilities

## Development Considerations

### Best Practices

#### Architecture Design

- **Modular Construction**: Build agents with clearly separated components for reasoning, memory, tool use, etc.
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Implement graceful degradation for when capabilities fail
- **Instrumentation**: Add comprehensive logging and telemetry from the start
- **Testing Harnesses**: Create reproducible environments for testing agent behavior

#### Implementation Strategy

- **Start Simple**: Begin with focused, narrow-scope agents before expanding
- **Human Oversight**: Implement appropriate human review processes
- **Iterative Development**: Release early, gather feedback, improve continuously
- **Capability Boundaries**: Clearly define what the agent should and shouldn't attempt

#### Deployment Approach

- **Controlled Rollout**: Start with limited user groups and gradually expand
- **Monitoring Plan**: Implement both technical and behavioral monitoring
- **Feedback Loops**: Create easy mechanisms for reporting issues
- **Version Control**: Maintain clear versioning for agent configurations

### Ethical Guidelines
