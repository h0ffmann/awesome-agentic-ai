## What is Agentic AI?

Agentic AI refers to AI systems that can autonomously or semi-autonomously take actions to accomplish tasks on behalf of users. These systems exhibit several key characteristics:

- **Autonomy**: Ability to operate with minimal human intervention
- **Tool Usage**: Capacity to use external tools, APIs, and interfaces designed for humans
- **Planning**: Capability to break down complex goals into sequential steps
- **Decision Making**: Making choices based on context, constraints, and objectives
- **Adaptation**: Adjusting strategies based on feedback or changing conditions
- **Reflection**: Evaluating performance and improving methods over time

Unlike traditional AI models that primarily respond to prompts, agentic AI systems can initiate actions, manage workflows, and persist in accomplishing goals across multiple interactions.
