## What is Agentic AI?
**Agentic AI** refers to systems designed to act autonomously with human-like agency, leveraging reasoning, planning, and environmental interaction.  
**Key Characteristics**:  
- **Autonomy**: Operate without constant human intervention.  
- **Goal-Driven**: Execute tasks to achieve predefined objectives.  
- **Adaptability**: Learn from feedback and adjust strategies.  
- **Multi-Modal Interaction**: Use tools (APIs, browsers, documents) and process text, images, or code.  
- **Ethical Safeguards**: Built-in alignment with human values.
