## Definition & Taxonomy
### What is Agentic AI?
Agentic AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that exhibit autonomy in decision-making, planning, and execution of tasks without requiring constant human supervision. These systems typically employ memory, reasoning, and tool use to accomplish their objectives efficiently.

### Taxonomy of Agentic AI
1. **Autonomous Agents** - Fully independent AI agents that execute tasks with minimal intervention.
2. **Assistive Agents** - AI agents that support humans by handling specific subtasks.
3. **Multi-Agent Systems** - Networks of AI agents collaborating to solve complex tasks.

### Key Capabilities
- **Autonomy** - Ability to make decisions independently.
- **Planning & Reasoning** - Structured decision-making frameworks.
- **Tool Use** - Integration with external APIs, databases, and applications.
- **Memory** - Retaining and recalling relevant information.

## Commercial Products
### Enterprise AI Solutions
- **Manus AI** - Enterprise-level AI agent for business process automation.
