# Awesome Agentic AI

A curated knowledge base of **Agentic AI** – autonomous AI agents that can perceive, reason, and act to achieve goals. This list follows the style of awesome lists, organizing key resources, tools, and information about Agentic AI.

## Definition & Overview

**Agentic AI** refers to AI systems designed to autonomously make decisions and take actions to achieve objectives with minimal human input. These agents combine technologies like large language models (LLMs), machine learning, and automation to analyze data, set goals, and execute tasks in open-ended environments ([What is Agentic AI? | UiPath](https://www.uipath.com/ai/agentic-ai#:~:text=Agentic%20AI%20is%20an%20emerging,and%20improving%20through%20every%20interaction)) ([Agentic AI vs. Generative AI | IBM](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/agentic-ai-vs-generative-ai#:~:text=Agentic%20AI%20describes%20AI%20systems,reactive%20to%20the%20users%20input)). Unlike generative AI (which focuses on creating content), agentic AI is *decision- and action-oriented* – it uses reasoning and iterative planning to tackle complex, multi-step problems without constant prompts or oversight ([Agentic AI vs. Generative AI | IBM](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/agentic-ai-vs-generative-ai#:~:text=Agentic%20AI%20is%20focused%20on,two%20terms%20and%20how%20each)) ([What Is Agentic AI?  | NVIDIA Blog](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-agentic-ai/#:~:text=What%20Is%20Agentic%20AI%3F)). By enabling machines to act independently in unstructured, real-world scenarios, agentic AI is redefining the scope of automation beyond static rule-based processes ([What is Agentic AI? | UiPath](https://www.uipath.com/ai/agentic-ai#:~:text=Agentic%20AI%20doesn%27t%20just%20enable,redefining%20what%20automation%20can%20achieve)).

**Key Characteristics:** Agentic AI systems exhibit several defining features that distinguish them from traditional AI or simple chatbots ([What Does “Agentic” Mean? A Definitive Guide to the AI Buzzword  | Moveworks](https://www.moveworks.com/us/en/resources/blog/what-does-agentic-mean#:~:text=What%20makes%20agentic%20AI%20stand,some%20of%20its%20defining%20characteristics)) ([What Does “Agentic” Mean? A Definitive Guide to the AI Buzzword  | Moveworks](https://www.moveworks.com/us/en/resources/blog/what-does-agentic-mean#:~:text=,solving)):

- **Autonomous Actions:** Capable of independent decision-making and acting without explicit human commands, allowing adaptation in dynamic environments ([What Does “Agentic” Mean? A Definitive Guide to the AI Buzzword  | Moveworks](https://www.moveworks.com/us/en/resources/blog/what-does-agentic-mean#:~:text=)).  
- **Goal-Oriented Behavior:** Able to set and pursue specific goals or sub-goals, making them proactive and strategic rather than purely reactive to inputs ([What Does “Agentic” Mean? A Definitive Guide to the AI Buzzword  | Moveworks](https://www.moveworks.com/us/en/resources/blog/what-does-agentic-mean#:~:text=%2A%20Goal)).  
- **Adaptive Learning:** Learn from experience and feedback, adjusting their strategies in real time. They use reasoning to self-optimize and stay on track toward goals even as conditions change ([What Does “Agentic” Mean? A Definitive Guide to the AI Buzzword  | Moveworks](https://www.moveworks.com/us/en/resources/blog/what-does-agentic-mean#:~:text=)).  
- **Reasoning & Planning:** Plan multi-step solutions and chain of actions. By leveraging logic and memory of past interactions, agentic AI can handle complex tasks that require multiple decisions and steps ([What Does “Agentic” Mean? A Definitive Guide to the AI Buzzword  | Moveworks](https://www.moveworks.com/us/en/resources/blog/what-does-agentic-mean#:~:text=,solving)).  
- **Proactive Problem-Solving:** Can identify problems or opportunities on their own, then take initiative to solve issues before they escalate – all aligned with the agent’s objectives ([What Does “Agentic” Mean? A Definitive Guide to the AI Buzzword  | Moveworks](https://www.moveworks.com/us/en/resources/blog/what-does-agentic-mean#:~:text=needed,solving)).

In essence, an agentic AI system behaves like a competent autonomous assistant: it understands high-level instructions, figures out the necessary tasks, and carries them out, adjusting as needed from start to finish ([What Does “Agentic” Mean? A Definitive Guide to the AI Buzzword  | Moveworks](https://www.moveworks.com/us/en/resources/blog/what-does-agentic-mean#:~:text=match%20at%20L199%20Essentially%2C%20agentic,actions%20based%20on%20changing%20conditions)) ([Agentic AI: 4 reasons why it’s the next big thing in AI research | IBM](https://www.ibm.com/think/insights/agentic-ai#:~:text=Agentic%20AI%20refers%20to%20a,ML%29%C2%A0models%20were%20trained)). This emerging approach opens up new possibilities for AI to drive workflows, whether it’s an AI autonomously booking travel, managing a business process, or controlling a robot, all with minimal supervision.

## Products

*Commercial solutions leveraging agentic AI principles:*

- **Moveworks (Agentic AI Platform)** – An enterprise AI platform that delivers *agentic workflow automation* and an AI assistant for employees. Moveworks’ system can autonomously handle employee requests (IT, HR, etc.) by reasoning through multi-step workflows and integrating with business apps via a growing plugin ecosystem ([Transform your workforce with the Moveworks Reasoning Engine](https://www.moveworks.com/us/en/platform/moveworks-ai#:~:text=Transform%20your%20workforce%20with%20Moveworks%E2%80%99,agentic%20AI)). (For example, it can evaluate resumes, answer support tickets, or route tasks to humans as needed, acting as a tireless virtual team member.)  
- **IBM watsonx Orchestrate** – IBM’s generative AI and automation solution for building AI agents in the enterprise. Watsonx Orchestrate lets organizations create AI-powered digital workers that integrate across applications and processes (e.g. HR, finance). These agents can be managed with enterprise guardrails and are context-aware, using business process intelligence to make decisions. For instance, an Orchestrate agent can extract data from emails or contracts and take action like updating a record or scheduling a follow-up ([Celonis + IBM watsonx Orchestrate: AI agents and automation enabled by Process Intelligence](https://www.celonis.com/blog/celonis-ibm-watsonx-orchestrate-ai-agents-and-automation-enabled-by-process-intelligence/#:~:text=IBM%20watsonx%20Orchestrate%20is%20an,on%20PO%2C%20invoice%2C%20master%20data)).  
- **UiPath Business Automation Platform** – A leading automation platform that combines RPA (robotic process automation) with agentic AI. UiPath’s platform enables orchestrating human employees, software bots, and AI agents together ([What is Agentic AI? | UiPath](https://www.uipath.com/ai/agentic-ai#:~:text=It%20is%20becoming%20increasingly%20clear,and%20better%20security%20and%20control)). Agentic AI capabilities (via UiPath’s AI Assistant) allow handling of unstructured tasks – the AI agents can understand context, interact with multiple systems (CRM, ERP, etc.), and adapt decisions using real-time data ([What is Agentic AI? | UiPath](https://www.uipath.com/ai/agentic-ai#:~:text=It%20integrates%20advanced%20AI%20with,UiPath%20Platform%E2%84%A2%2C%20enabling%20enterprises%20to)). This extends automation from repetitive tasks to more complex decision-based tasks in enterprise workflows.  
- **Aisera** – An AI service desk and IT automation product incorporating agentic AI to deliver end-to-end resolutions. Aisera’s platform uses multiple AI agents (powered by LLMs) to autonomously handle multi-step tasks in customer service and IT support, rather than just answering queries ([What is Agentic AI?](https://aisera.com/blog/agentic-ai/#:~:text=Agentic%20AI%20refers%20to%20an,based%20on%20context%20and%20objectives)) ([What is Agentic AI?](https://aisera.com/blog/agentic-ai/#:~:text=Agentic%20AI%20is%20a%20whole,can%20autonomously%20achieve%20business%20outcomes)). For example, an Aisera agent could understand a support request, dynamically troubleshoot across systems, and execute fixes or escalations – achieving business outcomes (like ticket resolution) without human intervention.  
- **Adept AI (ACT-1)** – A startup building *general AI agents* for software automation. Adept’s flagship model *ACT-1* is an “Action Transformer” that can observe a computer screen (via a vision model) and perform actions in applications like a human user ([Adept is an end-to-end multimodal AI agent. It uses software just like ...](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/17vvwjr/adept_is_an_endtoend_multimodal_ai_agent_it_uses/#:~:text=Adept%20is%20an%20end,and%20act%20on%20your%20computer)). This agent can take high-level commands and execute click, type, and navigation sequences across web or desktop software. Adept’s goal is to automate software workflows (e.g. updating spreadsheets, using enterprise apps) through natural language instructions ([Top 14 Agentic AI Tools](https://www.askui.com/blog-posts/top-14-agentic-ai-tools#:~:text=Adept%20focuses%20on%20agentic%20AI,platform%20actions)), effectively serving as a universal AI assistant for your tech stack.  
- **Zapier AI Agents** – Automation company Zapier offers *AI Agents (beta)* that let users create custom workflow assistants. Each agent can be given an objective and, via Zapier’s Natural Language Actions, can execute steps across 7,000+ integrated apps (e.g. sending emails, updating spreadsheets, posting to Slack) on the user’s behalf ([Build AI teammates with Zapier Agents](https://zapier.com/agents#:~:text=Build%20AI%20teammates%20with%20Zapier,command%20and%20while%20you%20sleep)). This allows non-technical users to deploy agentic AI to handle business processes (“do X every night” or “monitor Y and respond if Z”) while they sleep, essentially combining LLM reasoning with Zapier’s app automation.  
- **OpenAI ChatGPT Plugins** – *(Consumer-facing example)*. While not a standalone product, OpenAI’s ChatGPT (with Plugins and browsing) demonstrates agentic behavior. In plugin mode, ChatGPT can call external tools (for example, a web browser, code executor, or knowledge-base lookup) to fulfill user requests. This turns the chatbot into an agent that not only generates answers but also takes actions like retrieving live information, running calculations, or updating calendars. It’s a glimpse of agentic AI in a consumer assistant – e.g. asking ChatGPT to “plan a weekend trip” might prompt it to search flights, check weather, and produce a detailed plan autonomously.  
- **Others:** Many tech companies are adding agentic AI into products. For example, **Microsoft 365 Copilot** is integrating tool use (like operating Office apps via natural language), **Salesforce Einstein** is exploring autonomous CRM assistants, and **Amazon Alexa** is evolving to handle multi-step requests. These products indicate a trend of making AI not just a source of information, but an executor of tasks.

*(Above are just a selection – the agentic AI product landscape is rapidly growing.)*

## Open-Source Repositories

Open-source projects and frameworks related to agentic AI, grouped by functionality:

#### Autonomous Agent Frameworks 
- **Auto-GPT** – An open-source Python application that pioneered autonomous GPT-4 agents. Auto-GPT can recursively prompt itself to plan and execute tasks towards a high-level goal ([Top 14 Agentic AI Tools](https://www.askui.com/blog-posts/top-14-agentic-ai-tools#:~:text=AutoGPT)). It comes with tool integrations (web browsing, file read/write, etc.) and memory, enabling it to, for example, research a topic online and generate a report without user intervention. *(Repo: [Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT))*  
- **BabyAGI** – A simple task-driven agent framework that uses an LLM (like GPT-4) and a vector database to create, prioritize, and perform tasks in a loop towards an objective ([BabyAGI Explained: How AI Task Management Can Solve Complex ...](https://www.wordware.ai/blog/babyagi-explained-how-ai-task-management-can-solve-complex-problems#:~:text=BabyAGI%20Explained%3A%20How%20AI%20Task,simplest%20to%20the%20most%20complex)). Initially a proof-of-concept by Yohei Nakajima, BabyAGI spurred many variants. It demonstrates how an agent can break down a goal into sub-tasks, execute them one by one (creating new tasks as needed), and adjust based on results – all autonomously. *(Repo: [yoheinakajima/babyagi](https://github.com/yoheinakajima/babyagi))*  
- **AGiXT** – An open-source platform for AI task automation with adaptive memory and a plugin system. AGiXT allows multiple provider models (OpenAI, etc.) and tools, orchestrating them to handle complex instructions across domains. It’s designed to be extensible: users can add plugins for new tools or services, turning AGiXT into a customizable “AI agent router” for different tasks (from web research to controlling IoT devices). *(Repo: [Josh-XT/AGiXT](https://github.com/Josh-XT/AGiXT))*  
- **SuperAGI** – A developer-first framework to **build, manage, and run autonomous agents** reliably ([<⚡️> SuperAGI - A dev-first open source autonomous AI agent ...](https://github.com/TransformerOptimus/SuperAGI#:~:text=SuperAGI%20,autonomous%20agents%20quickly%20and%20reliably)). SuperAGI provides a middleware for chaining tools and LLM reasoning. Developers can define agent workflows and extend capabilities via a *Toolkit* marketplace ([GitHub - TransformerOptimus/SuperAGI: <⚡️> SuperAGI - A dev-first open source autonomous AI agent framework. Enabling developers to build, manage & run useful autonomous agents quickly and reliably.](https://github.com/TransformerOptimus/SuperAGI#:~:text=Toolkits)). Out-of-the-box, it supports features like Google search integration, file management, coding actions, and even multi-agent collaboration. Its focus is on scalability and an “AI app” architecture for running continuous agents. *(Repo: [TransformerOptimus/SuperAGI](https://github.com/TransformerOptimus/SuperAGI))*  

#### Agent Development Frameworks 
- **LangChain** – A popular framework for building applications with LLMs, which includes an “Agents” module. LangChain provides a standard interface to define an agent that can use **Tools** (functions such as web search, calculators, database queries, etc.) as part of its reasoning ([All Courses - LangChain Academy](https://academy.langchain.com/collections#:~:text=All%20Courses%20,package%2C%20LangGraph%20helps%20developers)). It comes with many pre-built tool integrations and supports memory, making it easier to prototype agentic AI behaviors. Developers can configure agents with different strategies (like React, Self-Ask) and chain them in sequences or even have them interact. *(Repo: [langchain-ai/langchain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain); see LangChain documentation for Agents)*  
- **Microsoft Autogen** – An open-source SDK and library by Microsoft for creating agentic AI interactions ([GitHub - microsoft/autogen: A programming framework for agentic AI  PyPi: autogen-agentchat Discord: https://aka.ms/autogen-discord Office Hour: https://aka.ms/autogen-officehour](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen#:~:text=,agent%20chat%20or%20group%20chats)). AutoGen supports defining multiple agents (e.g. an Assistant agent and a User agent proxy) that can converse and collaborate to solve tasks. It provides high-level APIs for common capabilities – **web browsing**, code execution, file I/O, etc., via extensions ([GitHub - microsoft/autogen: A programming framework for agentic AI  PyPi: autogen-agentchat Discord: https://aka.ms/autogen-discord Office Hour: https://aka.ms/autogen-officehour](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen#:~:text=match%20at%20L424%20built%20using,code%20execution%2C%20and%20file%20handling)). With AutoGen, one can set up scenarios like two agents debating a problem or an agent using a tool to fulfill a request. *(Repo: [microsoft/autogen](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen))*  
- **Transformers Agents (Hugging Face)** – An experimental toolkit that leverages Hugging Face’s model hub to give agents multi-modal abilities. Originally called *HuggingGPT*, this approach uses a manager LLM (like ChatGPT) to delegate subtasks to specialist models (for vision, speech, etc.) ([What is HuggingGPT by Hugging Face - Roger Basler De Roca](https://rogerbasler.ch/en/2023/04/11/what-is-hugginggpt-by-hugging-face/#:~:text=What%20is%20HuggingGPT%20by%20Hugging,solve%20complex%20tasks%2C%20leveraging)). Hugging Face’s `transformers.agents` API allows an agent to choose from tools such as image classifiers, text generators, or even other APIs to solve user queries. (It’s now evolving into a stand-alone library called **SmolAgents**.) This framework exemplifies how an LLM can orchestrate a team of AI models and tools through natural language. *(Repo: [huggingface/transformers Agents](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers), and [smol-ai/SMOL_AI](https://github.com/smol-ai/SMOL_AI))*  
- **OpenAI Function Calling** – *(API capability)*. OpenAI’s APIs for GPT-4/GPT-3.5 introduced a *function calling* feature, enabling developers to define tools that the model can invoke during conversation. While not a full framework on its own, this capability has been used to build many custom agents. For example, one can give GPT-4 a set of functions (for web requests, database queries, etc.); the model will decide if and when to call them as needed to answer a query. This turns a chatbot into an agent that can act. Several community projects (e.g. [func-ai/autoGPT](https://github.com/func-ai/autoGPT)) leverage function calling to create lightweight agentic systems without an extensive external library.

#### Specialized Projects 
- **Open Interpreter** – A tool that “bridges LLMs and your OS”, allowing natural language to execute code on your computer ([Top 14 Agentic AI Tools](https://www.askui.com/blog-posts/top-14-agentic-ai-tools#:~:text=Open%20Interpreter)). Open Interpreter lets you chat with an AI in your terminal that can run Python/JavaScript code, use shell commands, read/write files, and even control the browser. Essentially, it gives an AI agent access to your local environment safely. This is useful for data analysis, file transformations, or automating tasks through dialogue – for instance, asking the AI to visualize a dataset will have it write and run a Python script to generate a plot. *(Repo: [KillianLucas/Open-Interpreter](https://github.com/KillianLucas/Open-Interpreter))*  
- **Voyager** – An experimental agent that was the *first lifelong-learning LLM agent in Minecraft*. Voyager (Wang et al. 2023) uses GPT-4 to autonomously explore the game Minecraft, learning new skills without human demos. It writes code (using the game’s API), executes it to act in the world, learns from failures, and stores discoveries in a skill library. This project showcases an agent continually improving itself in an open-ended environment (Minecraft), hinting at how agentic AI can be applied to domains like game AI or robotics. *(Repo: [Voyager](https://github.com/MinecraftAgent/Voyager))*

- **Generative Agents Simulation** – *(Research code)*. This was the code released with the paper *“Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior” (Stanford, 2023)* ([Computational Agents Exhibit Believable Humanlike Behavior](https://hai.stanford.edu/news/computational-agents-exhibit-believable-humanlike-behavior#:~:text=Behavior%20hai,work%2C%20grab%20lunch%2C%20and)). It allowed 25 AI agents to live out lives in a simulated town (à la *The Sims*), each with memory and routines. The repository includes the core simulation module that enabled agents to plan their day (wake up, go to work, have conversations) and remember interactions. While more of a research demo than a reusable library, it inspired thinking about multi-agent environments and is a fun example to explore the emergent behavior of interacting agentic AIs. *(Repo: [joonspk/GenerativeAgents](https://github.com/joonspk/GenerativeAgents))*

- **The Auto-GPT & BabyAGI Phenomenon (Spring 2023):** In March–April 2023, open-source projects Auto-GPT and BabyAGI went viral, giving a first glimpse of autonomous AI agents to a wide audience. These experimental agents showed GPT-4 tackling goals like a human intern – e.g. browsing the web to gather information and then writing summaries, all on its own. Tech blogs and media (Fast Company, Zdnet, etc.) covered how such *“autonomous agents are bringing generative AI to the masses,”* sparking huge interest among developers and businesses. This hype also raised questions about reliability and control (as early Auto-GPT often got stuck or made errors without human guidance).  
- **IBM: Agentic AI as the Next Big Thing (Oct 2024):** IBM’s **Cole Stryker** published an article positioning agentic AI as the next leap in AI evolution ([Agentic AI: 4 reasons why it’s the next big thing in AI research | IBM](https://www.ibm.com/think/insights/agentic-ai#:~:text=For%20the%20last%20few%20years,the%20precision%20of%20traditional%20programming)). It defined agentic AI as systems with “agency” that can design their own workflows and use tools to act beyond their training data ([Agentic AI: 4 reasons why it’s the next big thing in AI research | IBM](https://www.ibm.com/think/insights/agentic-ai#:~:text=Agentic%20AI%20refers%20to%20a,ML%29%C2%A0models%20were%20trained)). IBM highlighted how these autonomous agents can handle complex, multi-step applications that traditional AI couldn’t, and suggested that the buzz is justified given the potential to turn AI from a passive analyst into an active problem-solver ([Agentic AI: 4 reasons why it’s the next big thing in AI research | IBM](https://www.ibm.com/think/insights/agentic-ai#:~:text=%28AI%29%20%C2%A0development%20communities%20recently,the%20precision%20of%20traditional%20programming)) ([Agentic AI: 4 reasons why it’s the next big thing in AI research | IBM](https://www.ibm.com/think/insights/agentic-ai#:~:text=user%20behavior%2C%20improving%20over%20time,modern%20organization%E2%80%99s%20process%20automation%20strategy)). (IBM has since integrated agentic capabilities into its WatsonX platform, signaling industry validation of the trend.)  
- **NVIDIA on Agentic AI (Oct 2024):** NVIDIA’s blog featured *“What is Agentic AI?”* explaining the concept and its importance for the future of AI-powered operations ([What Is Agentic AI?  | NVIDIA Blog](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-agentic-ai/#:~:text=What%20Is%20Agentic%20AI%3F)). It emphasized that agentic AI uses advanced reasoning and planning to autonomously solve multi-step problems, contrasting it with single-turn chatbots. NVIDIA described a four-step agent workflow: *Perceive, Reason, Act, and Learn* ([What Is Agentic AI?  | NVIDIA Blog](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-agentic-ai/#:~:text=Agentic%20AI%20uses%20a%20four,solving)) ([What Is Agentic AI?  | NVIDIA Blog](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-agentic-ai/#:~:text=data%20sources%20and%20deliver%20accurate%2C,above%20the%20amount%20would%20have)). They also discussed applications across industries – from customer service agents that can handle end-to-end queries, to software development copilots, to autonomous robots – essentially framing agentic AI as key to the next generation of AI solutions.  
- **MIT Technology Review on Manus (Mar 2025):** MIT Tech Review got exclusive access to **Manus**, a much-publicized general AI agent launched in China. In an article titled *“Everyone in AI is talking about Manus. We put it to the test.”*, author Zeyi Yang reports that Manus operates like “a highly intelligent and efficient intern,” capable of breaking down tasks and autonomously surfing the web for info ([Everyone in AI is talking about Manus. We put it to the test. | MIT Technology Review](https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/03/11/1113133/manus-ai-review/#:~:text=Like%20other%20reasoning,to%20intervene%20at%20any%20point)). Manus uses multiple AI models (Claude 3.5, fine-tuned Qwen, etc.) working in concert ([Everyone in AI is talking about Manus. We put it to the test. | MIT Technology Review](https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/03/11/1113133/manus-ai-review/#:~:text=Manus%20claims%20to%20be%20the,primarily%20designed%20for%20conversational%20interactions)), and features a unique *“Manus’s Computer”* interface that lets users watch and intervene in the agent’s actions ([Everyone in AI is talking about Manus. We put it to the test. | MIT Technology Review](https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/03/11/1113133/manus-ai-review/#:~:text=Like%20other%20reasoning,to%20intervene%20at%20any%20point)). While Manus impressed many experts (even Jack Dorsey praised it) and was dubbed “the second DeepSeek” in reference to an earlier breakthrough ([Everyone in AI is talking about Manus. We put it to the test. | MIT Technology Review](https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/03/11/1113133/manus-ai-review/#:~:text=Since%20the%20general%20AI%20agent,as%20well%20as%20its%20origin)), the review noted it isn’t perfect – it sometimes misunderstands requests or takes inefficient paths, though it improves with feedback ([Everyone in AI is talking about Manus. We put it to the test. | MIT Technology Review](https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/03/11/1113133/manus-ai-review/#:~:text=MIT%20Technology%20Review%20was%20able,it%E2%80%99s%20promising%20but%20not%20perfect)). The Manus hype underscores both excitement and caution around powerful autonomous agents.  
- **Forbes: The Agentic AI Race (Late 2024 – 2025):** Business outlets like Forbes have run pieces on how tech giants are racing to infuse agentic AI into their products. One November 2024 article titled *“The Agentic AI Race Is On, and The Blue Chips Are All In”* discussed how companies like Microsoft, Google, IBM, and Salesforce are investing heavily to add autonomous decision-making capabilities to their AI offerings. The article highlighted examples like Microsoft’s integration of agentic functions in Copilot, and IBM’s work on watsonx Orchestrate, arguing that enterprises see agentic AI as a competitive advantage in efficiency and automation. Another Forbes piece (Mar 2025) focused on Manus AI’s debut raised questions about ethics, security, and oversight ([AI Agent Manus Sparks Debate On Ethics, Security And Oversight](https://www.forbes.com/sites/torconstantino/2025/03/14/ai-agent-manus-sparks-debate-on-ethics-security-and-oversight/#:~:text=AI%20Agent%20Manus%20Sparks%20Debate,future%20intentions%2C%20abilities%20and%20decisions)) – experts debated how to ensure autonomous agents remain aligned with human intentions as they gain more control.  
- **Research Highlights:** Academic and corporate research in 2023-2024 yielded important advances for agentic AI:
  - *Generative Agents (Stanford)* – as mentioned, demonstrated believable social interactions between multiple agents, opening new research into multi-agent simulations and long-term memory ([Computational Agents Exhibit Believable Humanlike Behavior](https://hai.stanford.edu/news/computational-agents-exhibit-believable-humanlike-behavior#:~:text=Behavior%20hai,work%2C%20grab%20lunch%2C%20and)).  
  - *HuggingGPT (Microsoft)* – showed that an LLM like GPT-4 can serve as a “manager” to coordinate calls to other AI models, effectively turning a single chat into an orchestrated multi-model agent ([What is HuggingGPT by Hugging Face - Roger Basler De Roca](https://rogerbasler.ch/en/2023/04/11/what-is-hugginggpt-by-hugging-face/#:~:text=What%20is%20HuggingGPT%20by%20Hugging,solve%20complex%20tasks%2C%20leveraging)). This idea of *LLM as generalist planner* is influential in many agent frameworks.  
  - *Adaptive Agents in Robotics* – Google DeepMind and others have published papers on agents that use reinforcement learning combined with LLMs to perform tasks in the physical world (like SayCan for robot instructions, and Voyager’s Minecraft exploration). These demonstrate the span of agentic AI from purely digital to embodied contexts.  
  - *Tool Use and Self-Improvement* – Research on how agents can improve at tasks over time is ongoing. One example is the *Voyager* agent, which continuously learned new Minecraft skills without human help, writing its own code to navigate the game (a form of self-improvement loop). Another example is work on code-writing agents that fix their own bugs (e.g. “GPT-Coder” that debugs code it wrote). Such research blurs with concepts of recursive self-improvement, albeit in narrow domains.  

In summary, the past two years have seen agentic AI move from a niche concept to the forefront of AI discussions. Media coverage reflects both optimism about AI agents automating complex work, and concerns about how to keep these systems safe, ethical, and under control. Keeping an eye on reputable AI news sources, research blogs, and conference proceedings will be crucial as the technology and its applications continue to evolve at a rapid pace.

## Manus AI & Similar Tools

**Manus AI** has emerged in 2025 as a prominent example of an *agentic AI* in action. Developed by the Shenzhen-based startup Butterfly Effect, Manus is described as a “general AI agent that turns your thoughts into actions,” excelling at a wide range of tasks in work and life ([Manus](https://manus.im/#:~:text=Leave%20it%20to%20Manus)). It runs fully autonomously in the cloud – you give it a goal, and it handles the rest with no need for follow-up prompts or human “babysitting” ([Introducing Manus: The general AI agent — WorkOS](https://workos.com/blog/introducing-manus-the-general-ai-agent#:~:text=Introducing%20Manus%3A%20The%20general%20AI,agent)). Under the hood, Manus combines multiple AI models and a multi-agent architecture. For instance, it leverages Anthropic’s Claude 3.5 and fine-tuned versions of Alibaba’s Qwen model, among others, coordinating them to accomplish the user’s requests ([Everyone in AI is talking about Manus. We put it to the test. | MIT Technology Review](https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/03/11/1113133/manus-ai-review/#:~:text=Manus%20claims%20to%20be%20the,primarily%20designed%20for%20conversational%20interactions)). This multi-model approach allows Manus to handle complex tasks (research, data analysis, content creation) more robustly than a single model alone.

What sets Manus apart is its focus on delivering results, not just answers. In user demos, Manus has done things like: read a folder of résumés and produce a ranked shortlist with reasoning, or analyze stock data and generate a full report complete with charts. It doesn’t just chat; it produces work artifacts. The system will autonomously plan a task, e.g. “I need to gather information from X, then analyze it using Y, then compile the output,” and then execute those steps one by one. Manus can interact with tools like web browsers (for searching info) and can write to various output formats (Excel sheets, presentation slides, etc.), acting almost like a human virtual assistant performing a research project ([Introducing Manus: The general AI agent — WorkOS](https://workos.com/blog/introducing-manus-the-general-ai-agent#:~:text=Manus%20handles%20time,such%20as%20CSV%20or%20Excel)) ([Introducing Manus: The general AI agent — WorkOS](https://workos.com/blog/introducing-manus-the-general-ai-agent#:~:text=Unlike%20conventional%20chatbots%2C%20Manus%20isn%E2%80%99t,the%20results%20whenever%20you%20like)).

Manus’s interface features a *“Manus’s Computer”* window where users can actually watch what the agent is doing step-by-step – browsing websites, writing code, querying APIs – and intervene if needed ([Everyone in AI is talking about Manus. We put it to the test. | MIT Technology Review](https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/03/11/1113133/manus-ai-review/#:~:text=Like%20other%20reasoning,to%20intervene%20at%20any%20point)). This transparency is a design choice to build trust and allow course-correction if Manus goes off track. Early users have noted that while Manus is extraordinarily capable, it isn’t infallible: it might make wrong assumptions or take inefficient routes on occasion ([Everyone in AI is talking about Manus. We put it to the test. | MIT Technology Review](https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/03/11/1113133/manus-ai-review/#:~:text=MIT%20Technology%20Review%20was%20able,it%E2%80%99s%20promising%20but%20not%20perfect)). However, it can incorporate feedback and adjust, which is part of its agentic learning loop.

**Similar Tools:** Manus is part of a growing field of *“AI agents for everything.”* Notable counterparts and alternatives include:

- **ChatGPT + Advanced Plugins (DeepResearch):** OpenAI’s ChatGPT can be augmented with what some refer to as “DeepResearch” modes – essentially, giving ChatGPT access to the web and various plugins to act as an autonomous research assistant. For example, ChatGPT with browsing and tools enabled can take a complex question, break it down, search for information, and compile a report, much like Manus ([Everyone in AI is talking about Manus. We put it to the test. | MIT Technology Review](https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/03/11/1113133/manus-ai-review/#:~:text=Like%20other%20reasoning,to%20intervene%20at%20any%20point)). OpenAI has been more cautious, keeping a human-in-the-loop by default (ChatGPT will ask user permission before using certain tools), but the community has demonstrated unofficial mods where ChatGPT runs more freely (often dubbed “Auto-GPT in ChatGPT”). This is conceptually similar to Manus, though perhaps less seamless in execution.  
- **Auto-GPT and Forks:** As mentioned in the open-source section, Auto-GPT inspired many variants. Some, like **AgentGPT** (an online demo by Reworkd), provided a web UI for launching autonomous GPT agents. These tools can be seen as do-it-yourself versions of Manus – however, they typically require the user to have API keys and some setup, and they run on one model (GPT-4) rather than a purpose-built ensemble. Manus, being a managed cloud service, optimizes a lot under the hood (like choosing the right model for a subtask). Nonetheless, for those who can’t access Manus, open-source agents provide a taste of similar capabilities.  
- **Adept’s ACT-1 and Enterprise Agents:** Adept’s work on ACT-1 (and rumored upcoming products from Google DeepMind’s *Gemini* project, etc.) are in the same spirit: creating a single agent that can use many skills to do anything a user needs. These general agents aim to be the ultimate delegators – whether it’s interacting with a web browser, an operating system, or APIs. We will likely see more entrants in this “general agent” category in 2025. Manus currently has the first-mover advantage in terms of public attention, but competitors are on the horizon.  
- **Domain-Specific Autonomous Agents:** Manus is general-purpose, but there are also specialized agentic tools focusing on particular domains. For instance, **Grok (by X.AI)** is an AI aimed at browsing the web and answering questions (Elon Musk’s team’s project, often compared with ChatGPT’s browsing). **Google Bard with Extensions** can perform actions like checking your email or finding directions, making it a personal agent in Google’s ecosystem. **Microsoft’s GitHub Copilot X** introduced an “agent” mode that can autonomously draft and edit code, even raise pull requests – acting as a junior programmer that can take an issue and implement a solution with minimal guidance. These are all “similar tools” insofar as they let an AI not just respond, but *act* on a user’s behalf within a certain scope.

In summary, **Manus AI** represents the cutting edge of agentic AI being packaged into a user-friendly service. Its emergence has validated the concept that people *want* AI agents that can carry out tasks, not just chat. As Manus and its peers evolve, key issues like reliability, privacy, and ethical use are being hotly debated (as seen in Forbes and other outlets raising concerns about a fully autonomous agent running wild ([AI Agent Manus Sparks Debate On Ethics, Security And Oversight](https://www.forbes.com/sites/torconstantino/2025/03/14/ai-agent-manus-sparks-debate-on-ethics-security-and-oversight/#:~:text=AI%20Agent%20Manus%20Sparks%20Debate,future%20intentions%2C%20abilities%20and%20decisions))). But the trajectory is clear: we are entering an era where having an “AI agent” might become as common as having a human assistant, and Manus is one glimpse of that future.

Enabling developers to build, manage & run useful autonomous agents quickly and reliably.](https://github.com/TransformerOptimus/SuperAGI#:~:text=Toolkits)) |

*Notes:* “Web Browsing” indicates the agent can perform internet searches or open URLs to gather information. “GitHub/Code Integration” signifies ability to write code, use developer tools, or interface with code repositories (for example, Auto-GPT can write Python scripts to solve tasks, and plugins exist to create GitHub PRs). “Document Parsing” means the agent can ingest and understand external documents or files – e.g., reading PDFs or text files to use their content in reasoning. All of the listed frameworks are extensible, so even if something isn’t built-in (marked limited/partial), the community often adds plugins to achieve it. For instance, Auto-GPT’s plugin system ([Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT-Plugins - GitHub](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT-Plugins#:~:text=Significant,the%20plugin%20platform%20is%20installed)) includes plugins for things like PDF reading, email sending, etc., expanding its capabilities.
