## What is Agentic AI?

Agentic AI refers to AI systems designed to autonomously make decisions and take actions with minimal human supervision. These systems can:

- Autonomously make decisions and take actions toward complex goals
- Combine planning algorithms, reinforcement learning, and decision-making frameworks
- Operate independently, self-optimize, and adapt in real-time
- Connect to various enterprise data sources
- Use sophisticated reasoning and iterative planning
- Orchestrate the behavior of multiple specialized agents
- Solve multi-step problems requiring complex reasoning

Key characteristics that differentiate agentic AI from traditional AI systems:
- **Autonomy**: Can operate with minimal human intervention
- **Goal-oriented**: Can pursue complex objectives independently
- **Tool usage**: Can leverage external tools and APIs to accomplish tasks
- **Planning and reasoning**: Can break down tasks into manageable steps
- **Self-improvement**: Can learn from experience and optimize performance
